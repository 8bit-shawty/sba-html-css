# SBA DOM Manipulation
Skill Based Assessment using DOM Manipulation

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

Login Page has Javascript validation where if you leave the form blank or have an invalid email, it throws an error on the page. If you input a valid email it throws an alert that tells you that you have successfully logged in. Also, I iterated through a collection of Navbar links and displayed them at the top of my dashboard(although they are a little bit buggy. Havent figured out why yet)

## Lessons Learned:

Javascript Validation can be very useful to provide valid data and providing logic is very straightforward. Definitely need to add more validation to the other forms, just ran out of time. Also DOM Manipulation is very useful as well when working with form validations because it shows the guides the user to input the data that we want.
